OutGuess 0.3
------------

This version was fully reorganized. All source files were moved to /src, all
documents to /doc, etc. The autotools was fully reimplemented from zero. Some
documents were added and the README was reviewed. Some other improvements were
added.

OutGuess 0.2.1
--------------

The project is alive in GitHub. You are welcome to help.

This version is fully based in 0.2 version. All patches available in Debian
was applied here. Some fixes from Chris Rorvick[1] also are applied. I did
other adjustments too.

The jpeg-6b-steg/configure was removed because it have not a source code. See
more details here[2]. It is not a problem because we need static library
libjpeg.a only and we have a alternative Makefile to provide it inside the
same directory.
